# Weather_Dashboard
## Desccitpion

In this activity I created a webpage that allowed the user to input a city in the United States and they would get back the current weather conditions for that city along with the 5 day weather forecast for the next 5 days. I included api calls to gather the weather information from openweathermap.org.
