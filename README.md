# Weather_Dashboard
## desccitpion

In this activity I created a webpage that allowed the user to input a city in the United States and they would get back teh current weather conditions for htat city along with the 5 day weather forcast for the next 5 days. I included api calls to gather the weather infmmroation from openweathermap.org.
